Welcome 
==========

My name is Whales and this is my repository for my CodeAcademy projects!

This is still incomplete but main goal for this repo is to: 

1. To learn more and to learn better

2. Eventually create my own portfolio website after learning the JS/React framework.

3. To accept feedback and improve on how I approach these projects.
